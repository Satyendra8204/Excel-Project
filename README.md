Project Overview:

I took on an Excel project that focused on transforming raw data into meaningful insights using Excel. The objective was to analyze customer performance, market performance versus targets, and profit & loss (P&L) metrics.

Approach:

Using Power Query, I cleaned and merged data from various sources. I then built a robust data model that linked sales, customer, and financial data. This model allowed me to generate dynamic reports, including a Customer Performance Report that tracked sales growth across regions and a Market Performance vs. Target Report that compared actual results against business targets. Additionally, the P&L Analysis provided a clear view of profitability over time.
